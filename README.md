# Internship
My projects during the internship at the IDLab of Ghent University.

The repository consists of three projects: 
<br><br><b>Deep Sets</b>, a new neural network to train our agent. This is a neural network architecture promising to be scalable, meaning that you can train it in a smaller, less complex and computationally intensive environment and then apply it in a different, bigger one, without having to retrain 
<br><br><b>Predictions</b>,  where we added predictions of certain metrics in the agent's observation space
<br><br><b>Stable</b>, which is the version of the project developed in the gym-hpa paper (with some modifications).

<u><i>UPDATES:</i></u> <ul> <li> The paper regarding the <b>predictions</b> implementation is now published in the Journal of Network and Computer Applications: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2024.104067
<br> The official code of the paper is here: https://github.com/jpedro1992/gwydion</li>
<li> The paper regarding the <b>Deep Sets</b> implementation, titled <b>Can Reinforcement Learning be Generalized for
Efficient Auto-Scaling in Containerized Clouds?</b> has been accepted in the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium 2025.</li>
</ul>
